# Devspec Lite

New repository foundation: `projectcontext → techstack → codebase-structure → coding-standards → rules`. Existing repository baseline: `extract` completes the foundation, prepares the applicable diagram list, and asks whether to generate all or selected diagrams. Rare durable cross-work-item principles live in `constitution.md`; `projectcontext` promotes or retires them only on explicit input.

Work item: `story → grooming` when needed `→ finalize → tasks → implement → review`. Story intake accepts one manual request or, when an authenticated MCP connector is available, one read-only provider work-item reference.
After `story` selects a work item, use the normal work-item commands without repeating its ID. Per-worktree private context resolves the selected story and its recorded `next` action; use an ID only to switch or disambiguate stories.

Use `clarify` only for an active blocker and `quickfix` only for localized, low-risk changes. See `lifecycle.md` for all command transitions.

Each contract in `contracts/` states its own intent, scope, rules, and transitions, and loads the shared behavior it needs from `protocols/`: `state` for the run-state and evidence vocabulary, `run` for preflight and checkpoints, `work` for scope and change discipline, `ask` for material questions, `current-work-item` for ID-free continuation, `revision` for scope revisions, `repo-access` for repository boundaries, and `security` for the OWASP baseline. A rule belongs in a protocol when more than one command needs it.

`diagram` creates static SVG by default. Use `motion=explain` only for an evidence-backed sequence, flow, or state transition; animated output must retain complete static and reduced-motion meaning.
