  <scope>Use for new-repository foundation authoring or an explicitly requested targeted update. Use devspec.extract, not this command, to establish an existing-system baseline.</scope>
  <input>Repository layout, work area, integration, multi-repository context, or developer-defined structure update.</input>
  <rules>
    <rule>Map owned source roots, boundaries, integration points, and validation locations.</rule>
    <rule>For each repository, maintain a readable `text` layout tree rooted at its recorded local path. Include solution or manifest files, owned roots, meaningful modules, configuration, and integration or migration locations; keep it representative rather than exhaustive and exclude dependencies, caches, generated output, and secrets.</rule>
    <rule>For an explicit targeted update, accept a developer-provided layout tree or structure change without rerunning extraction. Mark developer-defined additions or changes as such, retain observed evidence where it remains accurate, and reconcile the repository table, layout tree, and area map.</rule>
    <rule>Use repo-access whenever scope or access evidence is missing and when work crosses repositories. Record one named least-privilege access requirement per repository; never infer access from its path.</rule>
  </rules>
  <entry>Completed technology stack in the new foundation chain, or an explicit targeted update; reject an existing-system baseline request.</entry>
