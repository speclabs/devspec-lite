  <scope>Use only for a requirement related to a work item that is already finalized. Use devspec.story for independent scope, and edit the story directly while it is still before finalization.</scope>
  <input>An optional work-item ID and one related missing requirement.</input>
  <rules>
    <rule>Append the next CR-### entry and CR-scoped criteria; never rewrite baseline evidence.</rule>
    <rule>List every requirement gap the change leaves open in story.md's Open Requirement Gaps table, raised by its CR-### ID, and ask none of them; devspec.refine owns those questions.</rule>
    <rule>Mark the earlier finalization, task, implementation, and review sections superseded when the revision increments, preserving their recorded evidence unchanged.</rule>
    <rule>Ask one material classification question when it is unclear whether the request is related or a new linked work item.</rule>
  </rules>
  <entry>Related requirement for a finalized-or-later work item with an active current scope revision; reject independent, blocked, or pre-finalization requests.</entry>
