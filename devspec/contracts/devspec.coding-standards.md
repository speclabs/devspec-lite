  <scope>Use for new-repository foundation authoring or an explicitly requested targeted update. Use devspec.extract, not this command, to establish an existing-system baseline.</scope>
  <input>Observed conventions, approved standards, or developer-defined custom standards with followable numbered examples or example updates.</input>
  <rules>
    <rule>Keep only conventions that change implementation or review behavior.</rule>
    <rule>For an observed convention, assign a stable `CS-###` ID, cite its local source evidence, and record concise fenced code or test snippets as linked `EX-###` entries under `## Standards Examples`. Record an anti-pattern when repository evidence supports one.</rule>
    <rule>Accept a custom standard explicitly supplied or approved by a developer even when no local source example exists. Mark it developer-defined rather than observed, record its approval or request as evidence, assign or retain a stable `CS-###` ID, and include a concise illustrative `EX-###` entry for future implementations. For a developer-defined example, identify its source as the user or developer directive and date.</rule>
    <rule>For an explicit targeted update, accept added, replaced, or retired standards examples without rerunning extraction. Preserve existing `CS-###` and `EX-###` IDs, create new IDs without renumbering historical entries, and reconcile each standard's linked example IDs and origin.</rule>
  </rules>
  <entry>Completed codebase structure in the new foundation chain, or an explicit targeted update; reject an existing-system baseline request.</entry>
