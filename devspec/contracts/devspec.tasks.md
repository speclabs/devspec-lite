  <scope>Use to turn a ready finalization into an ordered, independently verifiable plan. This command plans only; devspec.implement makes the changes.</scope>
  <input>An optional work-item ID with a ready current finalization brief.</input>
  <rules>
    <rule>Read only the current finalization brief, the story's current-revision criteria, and the foundation or architecture entries that brief already cites. Do not re-derive the traces from source or re-read unrelated foundation artifacts.</rule>
    <rule>Each task names scope, dependency, source justification, applicable decision or canonical rule IDs, validation, and done condition. Cite the finalization foundation and architecture traces for coding standards, codebase boundaries, diagrams, and OWASP controls instead of duplicating them per task.</rule>
    <rule>Order dependencies before dependents and split only work too broad to validate safely.</rule>
  </rules>
  <entry>Active work item at tasks with a ready finalization matching the current scope revision; reject blocked readiness evidence.</entry>
